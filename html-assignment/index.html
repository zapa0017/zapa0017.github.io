            <h2>About me!</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! my name is Nadia. I was born in Mexico, and I came to Canada eleven years ago. I prefer fall/winter weather over summer,
                which is a surprise for some people. I love all types of art such as: <b><em>digital, and visual art like paintings, drawings, and music.</em></b> 
                That's why I am taking this program. I am excited to learn and apply my knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                My favourite type of music is <b><em>Rock and Metal</em></b>. Also, I am into goth, mystic,
                halloween/horror movies, and memes. Worth mentioning that I love cats, especially my black cat named Olivia who we have nicknamed Olive, 
                because she is a <b><em>black olive!</em></b> I just love animals but not spiders or similar bugs. Animals are the best. 
                I went to see llamas this summer for my <em>27<sup>th</sup></em> birthday. I really loved how soft and calm they are. And that's all I can think of writing for now.
            </p>
